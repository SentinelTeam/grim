## Instructions for Codebuff Agent

- NEVER run code unless explicitly instructed by the user
- When refactoring code, preserve all existing comments that are not directly related to the changes being made
- Comments serve as documentation and should not be removed even if they seem obvious
- Only make changes directly related to the user's request - do not make additional "improvements"
- When moving code between files, preserve exact formatting, whitespace, and comments
